Aranya Kanda
==================================================

Chapter: 1
Verse: 1
Content: Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana enter the great forest called Dandaka Forest and adore the eminent sages, who are 
			in penance and hermitages in that forest. This canto is named as Aranya Kanda not just to show that Rama roved 
			over just forests. The forests, as per Indian tradition, are the treasure houses of knowledge, and they are 
			the ultimate in Vedic culture.
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 1
Verse: 2
Content: Thus, until Ayodhya Kanda Rama's exile is inaaryavarta, the place of noblemen, 
			from River Ganges to Greece. Now Rama is stepping into an area calledjanasthana,meaning 
			people's place. This janasthana is the place where Rama eradicated certain negative aspects of the then anarchic 
			individualised dominions where jungle law was the only recourse and brought all of them under one roof. Though 
			people lived there about along with sages and demons as well, demonic influence is said to be predominant, as 
			per Ramayana or other Purana-s. These demons are narrated to be man-eaters, but not cannibals who eat their 
			own tribesmen.Recent discoveries revealed that the first humans were cannibals.
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 1
Verse: 3
Content: The Science magazine reported about the excavations at Neanderthals Neander Valley, Germany. In the words of 
			Alban Defleur of the Universite de la Mediterranee at Masrseilles, France, "The finding allows us for the first 
			time to demonstrate the existence of the practice of cannibalism by European eanderthals." It is not clear from 
			the excavations of Neanderthals, whether the cannibalism was practised for survival or as a ritual.And even 
			at Alveston in the western English country of Gloucestershire, recently found are such human thighbones, which 
			had been split down the middle to remove marrow. Archaeologists of Bristol University are saying that the evidence 
			indicated the victims could have been disabled and deformed people in society. They have been murdered and eaten, 
			and the radiocarbon dating suggests these finds are about 2000 years ago. This practice is attributed to some 
			underworld cults during the later Iron Age. That being the situation in Europe, in the knowable history, in 
			Ramayana that has happened in an unknown era, the rakshasa-s are narrated to be man-eaters, but not as cannibals.But 
			the accounts given in Aranya Kanda and elsewhere, in ancient India the rakshasa-s ate up humans neither for 
			their own survival nor for ritual but to exhibit their tyranny and their barbaric supremacy. They never reported 
			to have eaten their own clansmen, but have a palate for other breed. Hence it is not exactly cannibalism, but 
			a barbaric act to exert savage scare. This is what the sages advise Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana when departing 
			towards Dandaka Aranya, and indirectly suggest eradicating such a savage atmosphere in peaceful forests.

Chapter: 1
Verse: 2000
Content: When it comes toisms, it is said that the whole clash is betweenVaishnavaitesandShaivitesorShaaktaites, because the raakshasa-s are invariably Shiva worshippers, where Vaishnavism 
			is a later development. All the raakshasa-s or demons [in fact the term 'demon' do not suit them,] portrayed 
			hereafter, are ardent worshippers of Shiva, and have every blessing from Shiva or Brahma. It is an ethnicity 
			of its own which lived rich lives, pompous in attributes, wielded magical powers, and unabatedly performed anything 
			that is beneficial for them.Their riches and glory will be reflected in Sundara Kanda, which will be burnt down 
			by Hanuma, humbling this deleterious ethnicity, even before Rama's war with Ravana. Such an ethnic culture will 
			be portrayed hereafter, in constant conflict with Rama, and Rama eradicating each and every member of such ethnicity 
			that goes against any civility.
----------------------------------------

Chapter: 1
Verse: 5
Content: Rama does much good in jansthana in wiping out those cultures of greedily dictatorial, magically overpowering, 
			and ruinous to other forms of civility. In fact this Aranya Kanda is not explained in vivid terms by the ancient 
			commentators, and if things are probed deeper in this book, Aranya Kanda, Rama did more social work than miracles.Hence 
			much can be explored into this Aranya Kaanda, the Book of Forest, in terms of sociological, demographically 
			and ethnological pursuits of Rama to establish one great orderly civil empire under one emperor, that is what 
			we call Rama Raajya. Further, it will be narrated that Rama killed these Rakshasas in thousands, which is objected 
			by materialists as how can an archer eliminate so many thousands of Rakshasas, with just a bow and arrows.It 
			may be remembered that Sage Viswamitra accords many kinds of missiles to Rama, after the killing of Tataka, 
			the demoness, in Bala Kanda.It may not be surprising for this generation to know that a single trigger can create 
			havoc of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, and then in all its probability Rama also might have triggered in the same way, 
			with the missiles endowed by Sage Viswamitra.
