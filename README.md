1. **Upload Files to Colab**:
   ```python
   # Create the required folder structure
   !mkdir -p data
   
   # Upload ramayana_classifier.py to the root directory
   # Upload all 7 .txt files to the data/ folder
   # Upload your input.csv file
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Fact Checker**:
   ```python
   !python ramayana_classifier.py --input input.csv --output output.csv --api-key YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY
   ```

### Option 2: Local Setup

1. **Clone/Download the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd IYD2
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Groq API Key**:
   - Get your free API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
   - Either pass it as argument or set as environment variable

4. **Run the Classifier**:
   ```bash
   python ramayana_classifier.py --input input.csv --output output.csv --api-key YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY
   ```

## 📦 Dependencies

The system requires the following packages (see `requirements.txt`):

```
# Core data processing
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0

# NLP and text processing
nltk>=3.8
inflect>=6.0.0

# API client
groq>=0.4.0

# Progress bars
tqdm>=4.64.0
```

**Note**: After installing nltk, you may need to download the WordNet dataset. The code handles this automatically, but if you encounter issues, manually run:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## 📋 Input Format

Your `input.csv` file should contain statements to classify. The system auto-detects the column name:

### Supported Column Names:
- `statement` (preferred)
- `claim`
- `text`
- `sentence`

If none of these are found, it uses the first column.

### Example input.csv:
```csv
statement
"Rama was the prince of Ayodhya"
"Ravana had ten heads and twenty arms"
"Hanuman was son of wind god Vayu"
"Python is a programming language"
"Bharata ruled Ayodhya during Rama's exile"
"Kumbhakarna slept for six months"
```

## 📊 Output Format

The system generates `output.csv` with exactly 3 columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `statement` | Original statement |
| `verdict` | Classification: TRUE/FALSE/IRRELEVANT |
| `reasoning` | One-sentence explanation for the classification |

### Example output.csv:
```csv
statement,verdict,reasoning
"Rama was the prince of Ayodhya",TRUE,"Rama was indeed the prince of Ayodhya according to Valmiki's Ramayana"
"Python is a programming language",IRRELEVANT,"This statement is about modern technology, not Ramayana"
"Ravana had ten arms",FALSE,"Ravana had 20 arms, not 10 arms according to the epic"
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. **Hybrid Classification System**

```
Input Statement
       ↓
1. Pattern Recognition (From supplementary file + dynamic regex)
       ↓
2. Smart Kanda Selection (Choose most relevant book)
       ↓
3. RAG Context Retrieval (Semantic chunking & entity matching)
       ↓
4. Groq LLM Reasoning (Llama3-8B-8192)
       ↓
5. Fallback Classification (Critical patterns + conservative defaults)
       ↓
Final Classification with Reasoning
```

### 2. **Smart Kanda Selection**

The system intelligently determines which Ramayana book is most relevant:

- **Bridge/War questions** → Yuddha Kanda (Book 6)
- **Marriage/Bow breaking** → Bala Kanda (Book 1)  
- **Exile details** → Ayodhya Kanda (Book 2)
- **Forest incidents** → Aranya Kanda (Book 3)
- **Monkey alliance** → Kishkindha Kanda (Book 4)
- **Hanuman's journey** → Sundara Kanda (Book 5)

### 3. **Dynamic Pattern Matching**

- **Semantic Groups**: Groups related words (death, grief, exile, etc.)
- **Character Variants**: Handles multiple names (Rama/Raghava/Ramachandra)
- **Tense Flexibility**: Matches both past and present tense variations
- **Inflect Integration**: Automatically handles plurals and word forms

### 4. **Classification Labels**

- **TRUE**: Statement is factually correct according to Valmiki's Ramayana
- **FALSE**: Statement contradicts established facts in the epic
- **IRRELEVANT**: Statement is not related to Ramayana (e.g., modern topics, programming)

## 🎯 System Architecture

### **Core Components**:

1. **DynamicRegexGenerator**: Creates flexible patterns using inflect and NLTK

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Command Line Options

```bash
python ramayana_classifier.py --input <input_file> --output <output_file> [--api-key <groq_key>]
```

**Parameters**:
- `--input`: Path to input CSV file (required)
- `--output`: Path to output CSV file (required)  
- `--api-key`: Groq API key (optional, can be set in code)

### API Configuration

The system uses Groq's Llama3-8B-8192 model with these settings:
- **Temperature**: 0.0 (deterministic)
- **Max tokens**: 50 (concise responses)
- **Rate limiting**: 1.5 seconds between requests
- **Retries**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff

### Memory Requirements

- **Minimum**: 2GB RAM (text processing only)
- **Recommended**: 4GB RAM for optimal performance
- **Network**: Internet connection required for Groq API

## 📚 Data Requirements

### Required Files in `data/` folder:

1. **valmiki_ramayan_supplementary_knowledge.txt** - Pattern database and curated facts
2. **valmiki_ramayan_bala_kanda_book1.txt** - Birth, childhood, marriage
3. **valmiki_ramayan_ayodhya_kanda_book2.txt** - Exile, succession, politics
4. **valmiki_ramayan_aranya_kanda_book3.txt** - Forest life, kidnapping
5. **valmiki_ramayan_kishkindha_kanda_book4.txt** - Monkey kingdom, alliances
6. **valmiki_ramayan_sundara_kanda_book5.txt** - Hanuman's journey, reconnaissance
7. **valmiki_ramayan_yuddha_kanda_book6.txt** - War, bridge, victory

**Critical**: All 7 files must be present. The system creates fallback chunks if files are missing but accuracy will be severely reduced.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. "Groq not available" error**
```bash
# Solution: Install groq package
pip install groq
```

**2. "Data directory not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Create data folder and add text files
mkdir data
# Then upload all 7 .txt files to data/
```

**3. "Dynamic regex not available"**
```bash
# Solution: Install missing NLP packages
pip install inflect nltk
```

**4. "API quota exceeded"**
```python
# Solution: Check your Groq API usage limits
# Get a new API key if needed
```

**5. "No patterns found in supplementary file"**
```python
# Solution: Ensure supplementary file contains pattern sections
# The system will use legacy patterns as fallback
```

### Performance Tips:

- **For faster processing**: Use a valid Groq API key (much faster than local models)
- **For higher accuracy**: Ensure all 7 text files are present and properly formatted
- **For debugging**: Check console logs for pattern matches and Kanda selection

## 📈 Example Results
